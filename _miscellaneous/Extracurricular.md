Apart from academics and research, Iâ€™m passionate about a range of stuff. Know more about some of them here!

# Mentoring

I am always excited about mentoring juniors on any aspects of undergraduate programs or research - be it related to courses, specializations, undergraduate research, or internship programs. As a Core Member of the EE Research Club, I take every possible opportunity to promote research at IITM, either by organizing talks or by having informal fireside chats with professors.

# Space

My fascination with space was taken to another level during the time when I was associated with Space Lab, IIT Madras. Getting to know the nitty-gritty details of building a satellite was cool, but getting to know what Space has to offer was cooler!

# Chess

I used to be a district-level chess champion in school, but now I play chess casually as a hobby.
