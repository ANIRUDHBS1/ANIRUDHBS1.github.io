Apart from academics and research, Iâ€™m passionate about a range of stuff. Know more about some of them here!

# Mentoring

I am always excited about mentoring juniors on any aspects of undergraduate programs or research.
I got admits from MIT/ Stanford/ UC Berkeley/ CalTech/ UCLA/ Columbia to pursue my graduate studies for Fall' 25. 

If you are EE or EP @ IITM, do check out the [EE Research Club Website](https://sites.google.com/smail.iitm.ac.in/eerc) and feel free to reach out to me via email. 

# Space

I have been fond of space and satellites ever since high school. As a member of Team [IITMSAT](https://sites.google.com/view/iitmsat), I had the privilege of engaging with scientists from ISRO and NASA. This unique experience allowed me to gain insights into the daily challenges and rewards of space exploration.

# Music

I've been learning to play the piano for the past couple of months. It's a wonderful way to unwind.

# Chess

I used to be a district-level chess champion in school, but now I play chess casually as a hobby.
