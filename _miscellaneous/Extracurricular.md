# Space

I have been fond of space and satellites ever since high school. As a member of Team [IITMSAT](https://sites.google.com/view/iitmsat), I had the privilege of engaging with scientists from ISRO and NASA. This unique experience allowed me to gain insights into the daily challenges and rewards of space exploration.

# Music

I've been learning to play the piano for the past couple of months. It's a wonderful way to unwind.

# Chess

I used to be a district-level chess champion in school, but now I play chess casually as a hobby.
