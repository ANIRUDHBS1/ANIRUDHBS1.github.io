I was a Teaching Assistant for the course EE2016 : Microprocessor Theory and Lab offered jointly by Prof. Manivasakan R and Prof. Sridharan K during Jul-Nov 23. This course serves as a continuation of the Digital Systems Lab offered in Jan-May 24. Through this course, students are exposed to the world of Microprocessors and Microcontrollers. My responsibilities included conducting weekly lab sessions, designing and conducting tutorial sessions and grading weekly quizzes.
