I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the course EE2001 : Digital Systems Lab course offered by Prof. Vinita Vasudevan in Jan-May 24. This is the introdutory lab course for undergraduate B.Tech students of EE. My responsibilities included conducting weekly lab sessions, and evaluating students. I also held periodic discussion and feedback sessions with my assigned group of students.
