<h2>Introduction</h2>

This report presents the design of an Operational Amplifier (OpAmp) used as a display driver in a smartwatch application. The subsequent sections encompass the entire design flow - starting from deciding high level design specifications to choice of topology and its reasoning to optimizing the parameters to achieve a high Figure of Merit (FoM) while meeting all specifications.

Figure 1 shows the block level specifications of (a) the display driver and (b) the load model.

<h2>Translating System Requirements to OpAmp Specifications</h2>

An Op-Amp used as a display driver needs to demonstrate a low settling time and a low settling error. Based on the requirement to drive 92480 pixels (obtained by multiplying 272 rows with 340 pixels per row) with a 60 Hz refresh rate, the settling time is computed as

$$T_{\text{set}} = \frac{1}{\text{No. of Pixels} \times \text{Refresh Rate}} = \frac{1}{92480 \times 60} \approx 180 \text{ns}$$

The total error provided in the design specification is a sum of the static error and the dynamic error. As a starting point, the total error ($$\epsilon$$ = 0.2%) is split equally between the dynamic ($$\epsilon_d$$) and static errors ($$\epsilon_s$$). The dynamic error and the settling time together help us in determining the minimum 3-dB bandwidth of the closed loop required

$$f_{\text{3dB}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{-\log (\epsilon_d)}{T_{\text{set}}} \approx 6.1 \text{ MHz}$$
