Hello!

I am Anirudh, a first-year PhD student advised by [Prof. Mekhail Anwar](http://anwarlab.org/) in the EECS department of [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). My research interests lie in semiconductors and integrated circuit design for biomedical applications. I have worked on a diverse variety of projects ranging from Mixed-Signal IC design for high speed and high frequency applications, to fabrication and modelling of semiconductor devices and Sustainability. I am also interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Integrated Circuit Design. 

I was awarded the [President of India Gold Medal at IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/happenings/press-releases-and-coverages/iit-madras-62nd-convocation-witnesses-graduation-3227)  where I received my Bachelor of Technology (Honours) degree in July 2025. I also received the award for the Best Thesis (across B.Tech, M.Tech, M.S. and PhD) on Power/Energy Saving for my work on "Estimating Memory Cost". During my undergraduate degree at IIT Madras, I'm incredibly fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Anjan Chakravorty](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/anjan/), Prof. [Sankaran Aniruddhan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ani/), Prof. [Avhishek Chatterjee](https://sites.google.com/site/avhishek1984/), Prof. [David Koilpillai](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/) and Prof. [Nagendra Krishnapura](http://ee.iitm.ac.in/~nagendra/).
