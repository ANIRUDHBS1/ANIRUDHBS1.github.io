Hello !

I am Anirudh B S, an Undergraduate Student at IIT Madras. I am passionate about Circuit Design and Semiconductor Technology. I have worked on a diverse variety of projects ranging from Mixed-Signal IC design for high speed and high frequency applications, to fabrication and modelling of semiconductor devices and Sustainability. I am also interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Integrated Circuit Design. 

During my undergraduate degree at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), I'm incredibly fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Anjan Chakravorty](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/anjan/), Prof. [Sankaran Aniruddhan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ani/), Prof. [Avhishek Chatterjee](https://sites.google.com/site/avhishek1984/), Prof. [David Koilpillai](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/) and Prof. [Nagendra Krishnapura](http://ee.iitm.ac.in/~nagendra/).
