Hello !

I am Anirudh B S, an Undegraduate Student at IIT Madras. I am passionate about Circuit Design and Semiconductor Technology. I have worked on a diverse variety of projects ranging from Mixed-Signal IC design for high speed and high frequency applications, to fabrication and modelling of semiconductor devices and Sustainability. I am also interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Integrated Circuit Design. I am currently working on designing a 6-bit Vector Summation based Phase Shifter for Ku-Band with Prof. Sankaran Aniruddhan and developing compact VerilogA based SPICE models for photonic components with Prof. Anjan Chakravorty.
