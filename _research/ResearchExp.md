I have delved into a range of projects revolving around Semiconductor Device Physics, Integrated Circuits and Systems, Communication and Signal Processing.  

# Estimating Memory Cost

Working on this project has fueled my interest in semiconductors and energy.

# Integrated Circuit Design and Testing

I also love working on Integrated Circuit Design and Testing. I have worked on projects ranging from schematic design to layout of chips. Some recent designs I worked on include - 

<ol>
<li>Design of a Programmable X band Filter (9 GHz to 10 GHz) - Schematic</li>
<li>Design of a 50 GHz Continuous Time Linear Equalizer for an ADC frontend - Schematic </li>
<li>Design of a 6 bit digitally controlled Ku Band Phase Shifter - Schematic and Layout </li>
</ol>

During my stay at IITMSAT, I got to test space grade PCBs and work on state of the art network analysers to characterise amplifiers and splitters in the RF chain.

# Distributed Modelling of Photonic Components

Of late, I have been interested in distributed SPICE modelling of photonic components.

# AI Circuits and Circuit Design Automation

I am also highly interested in the application of ML in Circuit Design and how circuit design can build faster AI hardware.
