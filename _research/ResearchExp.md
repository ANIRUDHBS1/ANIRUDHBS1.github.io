I have delved into a range of projects revolving around Semiconductor Device Physics, Integrated Circuits and Systems, Communication and Signal Processing.  


# Integrated Circuit Design and Testing

I love working on Integrated Circuit Design and Testing. I have worked on projects ranging from schematic design to layout of chips. Some recent designs I worked on include - 

<ol>
<li>Design of a Programmable X band Filter (9 GHz to 10 GHz) - High Input Power handling capability and selectivity.</li>
<li>Design of a 50 GHz Continuous Time Linear Equalizer for an ADC frontend - High Gain, Extremely good linearity. Drive 400fF at 50GHz.  </li>
<li>Design of a 6 bit digitally controlled Ku Band Phase Shifter - Low DNL, High Output P1dB</li>
</ol>

During my stay at IITMSAT, I got to test space grade PCBs and work with state-of-the-art network analysers to characterise amplifiers and splitters in the RF chain.

# Distributed Modelling of Photonic Components

I have been interested in compact modelling of photonic components.

# AI Circuits and Circuit Design Automation

I am deeply interested in the application of ML in Circuit Design and how circuit design can build faster AI hardware.

I worked on Automating RFIC Design in my junior year.More about my work can be found [here](https://github.com/ANIRUDHBS1/Automating-RF-Circuit-Synthesis)
