I have delved into a range of projects revolving around Semiconductor Device Physics, Integrated Circuits and Systems, Communication and Signal Processing.  

# Integrated Circuit Design and Testing

I have worked on Integrated Circuit Design and Testing. I experience in projects ranging from schematic design to layout of chips. Some recent designs I worked on include - 

<ol>
<li>Design of a Programmable X band Filter (9 GHz to 10 GHz) - High Input Power handling capability and selectivity.</li>
<li>Design of a 50 GHz Continuous Time Linear Equalizer for an ADC frontend - High Gain, High linearity.  </li>
<li>Design of a 6-bit Ku Band Phase Shifter - Low RMS Phase and Amplitude Errors, High Output P1dB</li>
</ol>

During my stay at IITMSAT, I got to test space grade PCBs and work with state-of-the-art network analysers to characterise amplifiers and splitters in the RF chain.

# Distributed Modelling of Photonic Components

Over the past couple of months, I have worked on Silicon Photonics. I am associated with the Center for Programmamble Photonic Integrated Circuits (CPPICS) at IIT Madras. My contribution has been towards developing Verilog A based compact models for photonic components.

# AI Circuits and Circuit Design Automation

I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Circuit Design. 

With the effective use of Machine Leaning in the circuit design sector, we can design robust and efficient chips. Over the last year, I worked on automating RF circuit design. More about my work can be found [here](https://github.com/ANIRUDHBS1/Automating-RF-Circuit-Synthesis).

Elegant circuit design principles can help in designing better AI hardware. During Fall 24, I enrolled in Neuromorphic Computing to learn about efficient circuit design techniques to accelerate Machine Learning Hardware.
