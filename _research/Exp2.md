# Estimating Memory Cost 

Modern computing systems are power hungry. Recent studies have shown that the energy consumption is rising at an alarming rate calling for the development of energy efficient computing paradigms, devices and circuits. This has led to the development of [Neuromorphic computing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-020-0208-2) and [Probabilistic Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06457). Recent literature also hints at the emergence of computing systems and devices inspired from human biology. 

Starting my sophomore year, I worked on developing a theoretical framework to estimate the energy expenditure of a memory block drawing inspiration from Markov Chains, Ising Model from Statistical Physics and Economics. I have been fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Anjan Chakravorty](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/anjan/), [Prof. Avhishek Chatterjee](https://sites.google.com/site/avhishek1984/) and [Prof. Bhaswar Chakrabarti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kyjPyQMAAAAJ&hl=en) on this exploratory problem statement.

I was awarded the Valadi Krishna Sarma Balaji & Savithri Balaji Award for the Best Thesis on Power/ Energy Savings across all degrees (B.Tech, M.Tech, M.S. and PhD) for my work on "Estimating Memory Cost" at the 62nd Convocation of IIT Madras.
