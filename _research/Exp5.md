# Compact SPICE Modelling of Photonic Components

During my last year at IIT Madras, I worked on Silicon Photonics. My work involved developing compact SPICE models for photonic components on a Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC). I was associated with the Center for Programmamble Photonic Integrated Circuits ([CPPICS](https://cppics.iitm.ac.in/)) at IIT Madras and was advised by [Prof. Anjan Chakravorty](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/anjan/). With the requirement of high bandwidth, low latency, low energy consumption systems for AI, Silicon Photonics has emerged as a popular choice for interconnects on a die. Modelling of such photonic components holds much value as it provides a circuit designer (photonic IC designer here) with insight to size passives and actives optimally for desired operation.
