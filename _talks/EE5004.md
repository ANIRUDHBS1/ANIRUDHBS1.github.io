This presentation was given as a part of the course EE5004 : Seminar on the History of Electrical Engineering.

As a part of EE5004 offered by [Prof. Deleep Nair](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~deleep/) in the Jan-May 2023 semester at IIT Madras, I gave a presentation on multicore processing. The talk focussed on the history of multicore processing - its evolution, need and future prospects. The material of the talk has been borrowed from several websites and papers that are cited in the Slides attached below. More of the presentations as a part of EE5004 can be found on Prof. Deleep's [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@deleepnair).
