This presentation was given as a part of the course EE6346 : Advanced CMOS Devices and Technologies. 

As a part of EE6346 offered by [Prof. Deleep Nair](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~deleep/) in the Jan-May 2025 semester at IIT Madras, I gave a presentation on the future of CMOS Scaling. During the talk, I focused on 2D materials and their promising role as channel materials for next-generation, advanced semiconductor nodes. I also discussed some key highlights of two recent publications on 2D materials at VLSI '25 and IEDM '24. The links to the papers are attached below.
