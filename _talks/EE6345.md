This presentation was given as a part of the course EE6345 : Advanced Memory Technology

As a part of EE6345 offered by [Prof. Anbarasu Manivannan](https://anbuchalcogen.wixsite.com/anbarasu/group-leader) in the Jan-May 2025 semester at IIT Madras, I gave a presentation on Neuromodulation. During the talk, I focused on a recently proposed ultrafast electron transfer mechanism in ZnAuPN. The area of nanoelectronics in the biomedical space is an evolving research domain. The proposition of connecting futuristic computing systems to the human brain and drawing inspiration from human biology is fascinating.
