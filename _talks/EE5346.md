This presentation was given as a part of the course EE5346 : Introduction to Plastic Electronics.

As a part of EE5346 offered by [Prof. Soumya Dutta](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=dpORFXAAAAAJ&hl=en) in the Jul-Nov 2024 semester at IIT Madras, I gave a presentation on an operational amplifier designed using organic semiconductors. During the talk, I gave insights on fabrication and/or deposition techniques of organic semiconductors to 'print' an OpAmp. I also discussed some key conclusions of the reference paper (linked below) and a couple of signal processing applications of this organic OpAmp.
