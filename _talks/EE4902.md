This talk was given as a part of my Undergraduate Research with Prof. Sankaran Aniruddhan. 

Circuit Design is extremely time intensive. Taping out a chip is often a year long endeavour. With the right use of Machine Learning, it is possible to significantly cut down on this design time. In my work with [Prof. Sankaran Aniruddhan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ani/), I developed an algorithm to speed up the schematic level design of RF circuits.
